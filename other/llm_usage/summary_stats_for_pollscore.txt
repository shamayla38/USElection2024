user: 

so these are the column names:

 [1] "poll_id"        "pollster_id"    "pollster"       "numeric_grade"  "pollscore"     
 [6] "state"          "start_date"     "poll_scope"     "end_date"       "sample_size"   
[11] "population"     "candidate_name" "pct"            "recency" 

you can focus on the poll_scope column, it has values of 'state' or 'national' so you can differentiate based on that. 

and for the rows that don't have a poll score, lets exclude them

how do i make a summary stats table for the pollscore?


ChatGPT:

Great! Now that I have the column names and clarification on the poll_scope and pollscore columns, we can move forward.

Plan for Summary Stats (Average Pollster Quality: pollscore)
Filter the data:
Exclude rows where pollscore is missing.
Separate the data into two groups: "national" and "state" based on the poll_scope column.
Calculate Summary Stats:
Calculate the mean, median, mode, minimum, and maximum pollscore for both national and state polls.
Steps for the R code:
Filtering the data based on poll_scope and pollscore.
Calculating summary statistics for both "state" and "national" polls.
Hereâ€™s how the code would look:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries (if not already loaded)
library(dplyr)

# Filter out rows where pollscore is missing and split by poll_scope
filtered_data <- dataset %>%
  filter(!is.na(pollscore)) # Removing rows with missing pollscore

# Create separate datasets for national and state polls
national_polls <- filtered_data %>% filter(poll_scope == "national")
state_polls <- filtered_data %>% filter(poll_scope == "state")

# Calculate summary statistics for both national and state polls
national_stats <- national_polls %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(pollscore),
    Median = median(pollscore),
    Min = min(pollscore),
    Max = max(pollscore)
  )

state_stats <- state_polls %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(pollscore),
    Median = median(pollscore),
    Min = min(pollscore),
    Max = max(pollscore)
  )

# Display the summary statistics
national_stats
state_stats

User: this doesn't work, please make it more simple. use the basic 'summary' stats function

ChatGPT: 

# Load necessary libraries (if not already loaded)
library(dplyr)

# Generate summary statistics for national and state polls
summary_stats <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(pollscore)) %>%  # Exclude rows with missing pollscore
  group_by(poll_scope) %>%        # Group by poll_scope
  summarize(
    Min = min(pollscore),
    `1st Qu.` = quantile(pollscore, 0.25),
    Median = median(pollscore),
    Mean = mean(pollscore),
    `3rd Qu.` = quantile(pollscore, 0.75),
    Max = max(pollscore),
    .groups = 'drop'  # Drop grouping structure for cleaner output
  )

# Print the summary statistics
print(summary_stats)
