this is the table i got for the numeric variables summary stats:

	Mean	SD	Min.	Median	Max.
Numeric Grade	2.3	0.6	1.1	2.0	3.0
Pollscore	−0.5	0.6	−1.5	−0.4	1.7
Sample Size	1962.5	2608.0	382.0	1000.0	12084.0
Num Support	949.2	1290.0	172.0	471.0	6042.0

can you write a short analysis about it? 

Here's a concise analysis of the summary statistics for the numeric variables:

The summary statistics for the numeric variables reveal important insights into the polling data. 

1. **Numeric Grade**: The mean numeric grade is 2.3 with a standard deviation of 0.6, indicating that most polls are graded around a middle value but can vary moderately. The minimum value of 1.1 and maximum of 3.0 suggest a range of poll quality, with some polls receiving low scores.

2. **Pollscore**: The average pollscore is −0.5, with a standard deviation of 0.6. This negative mean indicates that, on average, the polls might be skewing towards outcomes that are less favorable for certain candidates or parties. The minimum of −1.5 and maximum of 1.7 reveal a wide distribution of poll results, highlighting variability in the data.

3. **Sample Size**: The mean sample size of 1962.5, coupled with a substantial standard deviation of 2608.0, indicates significant variability in the number of respondents across polls. The minimum sample size of 382 and the maximum of 12,084 show that while many polls operate with relatively small sample sizes, some achieve much larger respondent pools, which may enhance the reliability of those findings.

4. **Num Support**: With a mean of 949.2 and a standard deviation of 1290.0, the average number of supporters reported is relatively high, though the variability indicates a wide range of support levels across polls. The minimum value of 172 and maximum of 6042 reflects the diverse contexts in which these polls were conducted.

Overall, these summary statistics highlight the variability and range present in the polling data, which may impact the reliability and interpretation of the findings. The presence of both low and high values in numeric grade, pollscore, and sample size emphasizes the importance of careful analysis when considering the results of polling efforts.
